# CS 143 Project

We built a mini IMDb Website on movies, actors and their reviews, supported by a relational database system. 

Our system manages all of its data at the back-end in a MySQL database and provides a Web interface to the users at the front-end. 

To develop Project we used the MySQL DBMS and the Linux operating system. 

We also used the PHP programming language to access MySQL and the Apache2 Web server to provide a Web interface. 

While there are many other ways to develop Web applications, Apache and PHP is one of the most popular method these days to implement a database-backed server for a small-to-medium scale Website.
